# QNickname #

Have you ever wondered, if I was a Qt class, which one would I be? Of the
millions of QClasses, which one would connect to QTrue? Through sophisticated
QMachineLearning we can now determine anyone's QNickname with QCertainty. So
make sure your QBrain has a public QSlot open, and we will QEmit your QNickname
directly into your QOpticNerve.

## Background ##

For technical reasons, QNickname is written in Rust.

## How To Build ##

If you haven't install Rust yet, you can do that easily with [`rustup`][1]!
