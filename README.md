# QNickName #

Have you ever wondered, if I was a Qt class, which one would I be? Of the
millions of QClasses, which one would connect to QTrue? Through sophisticated
QMachineLearning we can now determine anyone's QNickName with QCertainty. So
make sure your QBrain has a public QSlot open, and we will QEmit your QNickName
directly into your QOpticNerve.
